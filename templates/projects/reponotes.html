	<p>In addition to the functional aspects <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> provides, one which I, and many other developers, enjoy is the allowance of tracking a myriad of projects which entails a large variety of technologies and tools. Building up a project in tandem with learning a toolset is extremely satisfying over long periods of time. However, this can quickly get a tad out of hand as the scope of those projects increase over time.</p>

	<p>A simplistic approach I use personally is to just jot down notes and reminders for each project I'm working on at that time. Small pieces of information that help guide me back on track after a certain period of time has passed since I last looked at said project. Besides much more analog methods of keeping track, I failed to find an online tool that assisted in this specific, GitHub-centric use-case. Thus, <a href="https://jac21.github.io/RepoNotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RepoNotes</a>:</p>

	<p>The intent was to have a long-term persistent page that would allow me to have a few ideas about a particular repository saved until that idea's implementation/discarding. Usage itself is meant to accomplish just that: the user enters their GitHub username in the resulting form field, and submits. That submittal is treated as a request to the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Users API</a>. A JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Promise</a> is then resolved to return that user's GitHub repositories, which are then displayed in a simple list format, each with their own identifying title, text area, and save button.</p>

	</div>

	<p>At this point, the user can then enter text in the particular repository of choice, and save that note. This is accomplished using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localStorage</a> API, saving that note data to the user's browser storage for long-term persistence. This can be done for each of their repositories, and edited and modified and seen fit, leading to a simple and straightforward tracking of any "TODOs" or pending ideas. An additional feature allows the user to also export the current state of notes to a text file for any safe-keeping and tracking outside of the web application.</p>
