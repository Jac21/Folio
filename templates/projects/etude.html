	<p>One of my favorite pastimes, music, and subsequently the creation process with others can be hindered by a very common issue I've faced the past few years. Distance between those I enjoy working with in-person can halt a set of ideas or project immediately. To assist with ideation, the occasional iPhone recording helps, but can never replace the ferocity an in-person session can bring about, and the abundance of ideas constantly thrown around. On a personal level, I've tried working with varying ways of mitigating that issue of distance, the best solution so far being an organizational endeavor using online hosting tools such as Google Drive and Dropbox.</p>

	<p>For the <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/festivals/music-hackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 SXSW Music Hackathon</a>, there were three "hack categories" my partner and I could tackle: Commerce, Creation, and Consumer. An idea then sparked from the aforementioned issue, that being of bringing the ideals of software development version control into the music creation process. The style of music my scattered group of friends endeavor to create requires a large amount of collaboration, in the same way large pieces of software require some form of version control to ensure an effective creation process. Taking cues from the most common of these collaboration platforms, GitHub, my partner and I's first task was creating mock-ups using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balsamiq</a> during our ideation process.</p>

	<p>The general idea was simple: allow users of the platform to create projects (representative of a single song) which contains its own history of tracks they can then upload. A track can be an audio file that contains a single component of that song, for instance, the drums. We then chose to visualize songs as trees, in which the user could initiate one from the root track of the song, and then gradually add nodes/other tracks in branching paths of their choice, either to represent a certain format in which the song could take, or to better organize their ideas as a whole.</p>
